## üé¨ CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS (High Impact)

### 1. Hero Section - Create a Showstopping Entrance
**Current Issue:** Home page lacks cinematic impact

**Recommendations:**
- **Full-screen video hero** with film reel of your best work (3-5 seconds per clip)
- **Cinematic typography** - use film industry fonts (e.g., Bebas Neue, Playfair Display for headers)
- **Animated title reveal** with fade-in/typewriter effect for "Emmy-Nominated Makeup & Hair Designer"
- **Parallax scrolling** on hero images
- **Film strip frame** overlays for authenticity

### 2. Color Palette - Hollywood Glamour
**Current:** Generic teal/zinc palette

**Recommended Palette:**
```
Primary: #D4AF37 (Gold - Emmy/Oscar reference)
Secondary: #1A1A1A (Cinematic black)
Accent: #8B0000 (Deep red carpet red)
Neutral: Champagne/cream tones
Highlights: Soft spotlight whites
```

### 3. Gallery Reimagined
**Current Issues:**
- Masonry layout is functional but not immersive
- No project context
- Missing lightbox modal
- Photos overlap on resize (FIXED ‚úì)

**Recommendations:**
- **Lightbox modal** with project details:
  - Production name
  - Network/Studio
  - Year & role
  - Actors featured
  - Behind-the-scenes notes
- **Hover effects**: Film frame overlay with production title
- **Filter system**: By category (Film, TV, Commercials, Events)
- **Grid-to-detail** cinematic transition (zoom + fade to black)
- **Before/After slider** for transformation shots
- **Carousel mode** for project series

### 4. Typography Hierarchy
**Current:** Text is flat and lacks drama

**Recommendations:**
```css
Hero titles: 4xl-6xl, bold, letter-spacing: -0.02em
Section headers: Use film slate aesthetic
Body: Increase line-height to 1.7 for readability
Credits: Use italics with smaller, elegant serif
Add gold underlines for emphasis
```
